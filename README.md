# An-E-commerce-website

This is a simple e-commerce website for games and accersories for xbox lovers. That is a bit of biase there but i guess it's allowed.
This website has an homepage, shop, checkout page and a login page which are all interlinked meaning you can navigate through the each webpage through the homepage. 
This website was mainly built as cs50 final project work

There was a difficult period during the building of this project as I had exams within that period. Learning on my own with youtube and websites like freecodecamp and w3schools took a lot of time. I wanted to gain more understanding with the languages like Javascript.

HOW TO USE
This program works perfectly on any web browser either in widows or mac (I've not tried it with the mac yet but hope it does). 
It doesn't have the backend aspect of web programming so forms on the login, register and checkout pages will not do what it's supposed to.
A simple navigation on the  website is all it takes to be able to use it

There was a lot of times to checked on stack overflow for answer to questions like "how to make the search button work in jquey".
I've still not done that yet and I'm open to anybody helping with that.

I'm open to contributions and ideas of easier ways of doing some of the thing i did throughtout the project.
